      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/Local-Web/campsite">Campsite</a> is a
        proof-of-concept implementation of a server embodying values of the
        Local Web. This project will make it possible to create a Local Web
        server, define the welcoming and onboarding flow, define sub-spaces
        within the site, and provide a chat service for a few dozen people.
      </p>
      <p>
        People will not need to download specific software to use Campsite.
        However, it will also be designed so software developers can write
        applications connecting to a Campsite instance. It is written in Node.js
        and uses WebSocket for the connections.
