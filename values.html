      <h1>Local Web Values</h1>

      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>
        Participants should feel welcome and included as they join a Local Web
        network. As participants are welcomed to a network, they should extend
        the same welcome and inclusion to others present. For everyoneâ€™s safety,
        a Code of Conduct should be readily accessible and applied equally.
      </p>

      <h2>Self-Determination</h2>
      <p>
        Aside from a name, personal profiles should have no required data.
        People are free to represent themselves however they wish. The name
        given does not need to be a legal name, nor does not need to be
        consistent between different networks. People are also free to accept or
        refuse participation in any of the activities of a Local Web.
      </p>

      <h2>Authenticity</h2>
      <p>
        Joining a Local Web network should be a deliberate action. People should
        ensure the network they are joining is authentic before presenting their
        name or profile. In turn, networks should ensure people are not hindered
        from representing their authentic selves. Personal authenticity may look
        different from day to day and network to network.
      </p>

      <h2>Decentralization</h2>
      <p>
        Communication over a Local Web should happen directly between
        participants. While the establishment of the network may need some level
        of centralized coordination (e.g., a conventional WWW site for signaling
        and directory assistance), individual networks should be independent of
        each other. One network should not rely on content shared in another
        network.
      </p>

      <h2>Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        A Local Web network is not automatically available to the entire public
        world. While participants may join a network through a public venue
        (e.g., coffeeshop, non-profit organization, etc...), that venue may not
        necessarily receive everyone who attempts to join. Participants must be
        a part of a specific network before accessing the data within it.
